I am a Ph.D. candidate in Astronomy at [Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille](https://www.lam.fr/?lang=en) (LAM) under the supervision of Elodie Choquet and Arthur Vigan.
My Ph.D. thesis is about developing advanced post-processing methods for ground-based high contrast imagers to better detect and characterize exoplanets and their environments.

My research focuses on:
* Direct imaging of exoplanets and circumstellar disks
* Post-processing methods for high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy data
* Planet-disk interaction 
* Using integral-field spectroscopy for the detection and characterization of proto-planets and their formation

Before my Ph.D. research, I also had experience in [radio astronomy](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A...3X/abstract) and [galaxy research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...824L..17X/abstract).  
I earned my M.Sc in Astronomy from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy) in 2020 and my B.S. in Physics from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn) in 2016.
