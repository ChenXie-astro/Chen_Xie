# Planet-disk interaction 

(Ongoing project)
Investigating the companion-disk interaction via measuring the dynamical motion of spiral arms in the disk.


# Performance of reference-star differential imaging on SPHERE
(under review) To be completed soon.

# Discovery of two new radio halos
Xie, C. et al. 2020; [A&A](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2020/04/aa36953-19.pdf), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04725.pdf), [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...636A...3X/abstract)

We reported the discovery of two new radio halos in the frontier fields clusters Abell S1063 and Abell 370. I processed and analyzed the radio data obtained by VLA and GMRT in 325 MHz, 1.5 GHz, and 3 GHz. Besides the discovery, I also found one of the radio halos in AbellS 1063 has spectral steeping, which suggests the formation of the radio halo is caused by the turbulent reacceleration.

To further confirm the spectral steepening, I led the follow-up observation (~16 hours) with VLA and GMRT to have a wide wavelength coverage from 0.1 to 6 GHz.
